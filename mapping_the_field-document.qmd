# Abstract

300 word maximum.

# Keywords

Keyword 1, keyword 2... up to 6?

Start typing your introduction here. Please do not use the word "Introduction" as an initial heading, since your paper is supposed to begin with an introduction. The introduction shall present the research question including key definitions, and spell out the stakes, objectives and scope of the literature review. The last paragraph of the introduction shall list the major remaining sections, which in principle include the presentation of the method adopted for the literature review, the results obtained, the discussion of results and the conclusion. In the main text, while presenting the review method, the authors shall identify the data sources and discuss their respective quality. The discussion shall outline convergences and divergences with respect to existing literature, and also identify blindspots that are worth research consideration in future.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
